# project-landing-page
On this website I used everything I learned through The Odin Project from HTML and CSS, one of the hardest parts for me is the containers- flexbox. I will come back to practice this skill until I have no problem finding solution in my own head. Over all it was fun and challenging, I had to check other people solution, just to realize I missed some divs and I needed to add paddings to the left and right, so all looks centered, although I think there is other solution to that too.

At this point I will not add any text-images, because I want to continue further, but as I said I will come back, cause I don't feel confident enough with containers and how to flex items.
